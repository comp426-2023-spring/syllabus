#### Assignment submission

All assignments will be handled by GitHub classroom.
Pushing code to the repository created when you accept assignments will submit the assignment to check for errors. If all checks pass, then you get all the points!

You can submit (push) as many times as you need to in order to pass the checks configured in GitHub classroom.

You will write most of the test scripts yourself. The purpose of the checks is not to get a grade: it is to develop software that works, and works well.

There are due dates for the assignments, but the due date will not cut off submission.

You will **always** be able to submit or resubmit after the due date has passed. 

**You will not lose points for pushing code to your assignment repos after the due date for a given assignment has passed, ever.** You will, however, gain bonus points if you submit your assignments _before_ the due dates.

It is in your interest to keep up to date with assignments. They will track relatively closely with what we are covering in the live sessions. 

### Final project assignment (a99)

If you elect to do so in lieu of a [comprehensive final exam](./exams.md#comprehensive-final-exam), you will work on a team of three (3) people to build a web application. It can be whatever your team wants. the main purpose of the final project is learning how to collaborate in order to scope, plan, document, organize, and build a prototype. 

Your team will use GitHub to plan and manage your project. User the projects tool and the discussion board attached to your team's repository. 

You will create documentation for both developers and users of your app.
Ideally, you would start with documentation 

It is okay for your project to still be a work in progress when you submit it at the end of the semester. We are looking for prototypes and demonstrate a grasp of concepts.

All final project materials will be due on the day scheduled for the final exam.

The assignment instructions repo will have more details.
