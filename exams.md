# Exams

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

There will be several exams throughout the course.

The first of these will happen in the first week of the semester. 

You will take a questionnaire at the beginning of the course that gives us a baseline for your familiarity with certain tools and concepts. This also provides the instructional staff with basic information about you, like your GitHub username, so that we can add you to the course organization properly.

There will also be midterm and final questionnaires, but they will not assess specific knowledge in the way a traditional exam does.
Instead they will assess your familiarity with concepts and tools that we are using in the course and allow us to compare across the semester.

| Exam | Purpose | Form | Points |
|:--- |:--- |:--- | ---:|
| e00 | Beginning: establish a baseline for skills and topic familiarity| Questionnaire + GitHub Classroom | 25,000 + 25,000 |
| e01 | Midterm: progress and check-in | Questionnaire | 50,000|
| e02 | Final: self- and team-assessment (project option) | Questionnaire | 50,000 |
| e02 | Final: self-assessment and exam (exam option) | Questionnaire + GitHub Classroom | 50,000 + 300,000 |

The midterm and final will include a self-assessment component and also an assessment of your team dynamics.

These assessments are designed to evaluate our teaching effectiveness as much as they are designed to assess your skill and familiarity with concepts and tools.

### Comprehensive Final Exam

There is an option to take a final exam instead of conducting a [collaborative software development project](./assignments.md#final-project-assignment-a99).

You are given the option of choosing one or the other on the first day of class.

Choose wisely.

The final exam will be an integration project. You will be provided a framework and will be expected to integrate your a04 API into the backend and put a front-end web interface on it.

If you are good, and know your documentation, you can complete this exam in approximately 3 hours. If not, it will take you longer. No support will be offered by the instructional staff for the exam. You will be expected to test your own code. The evaluation system will not provide immediate feedback to you until LDOC. The exam will open the last week of class.

You will have from exam opening until the final exam date to complete the exam. See schedule for details.
